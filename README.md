# Task Scheduling Algorithm

Task scheduling is a fundamental problem in computer science, cropping up in various contexts such as operating systems, cloud computing, and project management. It involves optimizing the allocation of tasks with varying processing times, dependencies, and resource requirements to minimize the makespan â€“ the total time required to complete all tasks. Since this problem is NP-hard, meaning there's no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it, we rely on heuristic and approximation algorithms to find practical solutions.

## Algorithm Overview

Here's a simple greedy algorithm for solving the task scheduling problem:

### Input
- A set of n tasks with processing times: p1, p2, ..., pn
- m resources

### Output
- A schedule that minimizes the overall makespan by assigning tasks to resources

### Algorithm Steps

1. Sort the tasks in descending order of their processing times.
2. Create an array `finish_time[1...m]` to track the finish time of each resource, initially set to zero.
3. For each task i from 1 to n, follow these steps:
    a. Find the resource r with the earliest finish time among all resources.
    b. Assign task i to resource r.
    c. Update the finish time of resource r by adding the processing time of task i.
4. Return the schedule.

This algorithm works by prioritizing tasks with longer processing times, then assigns them to resources with the earliest availability. It ensures no two tasks are assigned to the same resource at the same time and strives to minimize the makespan.
